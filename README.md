This project is to build machine learning models based on the concepts. Our goal is to go through machine learning, comprehend the concepts, and employ them to solve problems. That is to learn mathematics behind these algorithms. We will understand the basic concepts as well as implement the algorithms in Python/Pycharm which is an Integrated Development Environment. The following will demonstrate how each algorithm works.
