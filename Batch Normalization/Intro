This is to implement the algorithms mentioned in Batch Normalization: Accelerating Deep Network Training by
Reducing Internal Covariate Shift.

## Batch Normalization
Please refer to the paper.

## BN_Model
We use a shallow neural network to add batch normalization in. Then we build a model.

## Train
Train.py

## Evaluate
Evaluate.py

## Retrain
Retrain.py

We can observe that the accuracy is improved significantly.
