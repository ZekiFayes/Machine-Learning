This is to pretrain a shallow neural network. We refer to Reducing the Dimensionality of Data with Neural Networks - Hinton.

In the paper, the author uses RBMs to pretrain an AutoEncoder. Here, we use Autoencoders to pretrain a shallow neural network.
We also use RBMs to pretrain a shallow neural network. We achieve relatively good results using both pretraining methods.

## Model
The basic model is SNN. But we add some autoencoders to pretrain the model.
We also add some subplots to monitor the weights and biases. 
Last, we generate a .gif to show how the weights and biases vary with time.


We observe that the accuracy is improved due to pretraining.
